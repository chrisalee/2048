# 2048

2048 is an easy and fun puzzle game. 
Even if you don't love numbers you will love this game. 
It is played on a 4x4 grid using the arrows keys alternatively. 
Every time you press a key - all tiles slide. 
Tiles with the same value that bump into one-another are merged. 
Although there might be an optimal strategy to play, there is always some level of chance.
